# JuStu
This Is an archive of my c learning process in a project called *Juniorstudium* at the *University of Rostock* in Germany,
dedicated to letting german students from across the country and starting at as early as 8th grade, experience learning at a University to some degree
and giving an insight on various courses of studying.
This of course is specificly about my 2 semesters of *Imperative Programming*. It's a git repo after all.
It includes all tasks, my solutions to them and my personal notes.

#### LEGAL DISCLAIMER
I can't however include any of the original documents or recordings of lecures, we were given, as they are legally owned by the *UNI Rostock* and per se not allowed for public sharing.
Therefore all tasks included in this repository are translated and reinterpreted by me.

**ATTENTION: The archive is unfinished and doesn't contain all described content yet. It will get updated from time to time.**
