I rushed through the first 2 tasks with ease, as I hadn't been new
to programming at all and had already written some scripts using JavaScript and Python for a few years.
Though for the second I of course had to research the ANSI standard, but you know, what they say: Your most
important skill as a programmer is to use google (or DuckDuckGo in my case).

The third task took me some time to be honest, but after looking up how to algorithmically
convert base 10 to binary values, it wasn't that big of a deal.

Identifying the biggest of some numbers was a breeze, even without if-statements and ternary operators.
There's always the good ol' switch statement. Not an ideal use case for it, but gets the job done.
Though it probably was supposed to be solved different. I'm not sure..., but I'll tell you as soon as I found out.

The fith task on the other hand was my nemesis. First of all it was requiring a much more complex algorithm
than any of the tasks before, which btw was the lesser of the two evils.
Because second of all I had never seen a series expansion in my life and no idea how to interpret it.
I've been only 9th grade after all.
Even upon researching it for about an hour I had no idea what was asked of me. So I reached out to a friend,
who also participated in the "Juniorstudium" and together we figured it out, or actually he rather explained it to me.
